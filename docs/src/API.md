# API

This page lists all exported methods, organizing them by topic (whether it is a method that acts on vertices, edges, layers, etc) and by audience: due to how it was possible to integrate multilayer graphs within the `Graphs.jl` ecosystem, some methods are intended for developers who wish to use this library just as any other `Graphs.jl` package in their code, while others are meant to be employed by the end-user.
