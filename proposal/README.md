## What 

WAW 2023 invites original research papers and abstracts on all aspects of algorithmic and mathematical research in the areas pertaining to the World-Wide Web, especially papers that espouse the view of complex data as networks.

### Aim

To further the understanding of graphs that arise from the Web and various user activities on the Web, and stimulate the development of high-performance algorithms and applications that exploit these graphs. The workshop will also welcome the researchers who are working on graph-theoretic and algorithmic aspects of citation networks, social networks, biological networks, molecular networks, and the Internet.

### Contents 

- **Algorithms**: graph algorithms, clustering, collaborative filtering, routing optimization.
- **Analysis**: structural properties, visualization, patterns, communities, discovery, flow simulation.
- **Data Models**: hypergraph models, graph models, evolution, trust and reputation networks.
- **Topics**: Web, social networks, transportation networks, communication networks, recommender networks, citation networks, Wikipedia, biological networks, blogs, p2p.
- **Applications**: web mining, social applications, routing & transportation, web search and ranking.
