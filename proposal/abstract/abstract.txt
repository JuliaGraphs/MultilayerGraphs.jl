MultilayerGraphs.jl [1] is a Julia package for the creation, manipulation and analysis of the structure, dynamics and functions of multilayer graphs. 

A multilayer graph consists of multiple subgraphs called layers which can be interconnected through bipartite graphs called interlayers composed of the sets of vertices of two different layers and the edges between them. 

In order to formally represent multilayer networks, multiple theoretical paradigms have been proposed and adopted to model a wide spectrum of high-dimensional, multi-scale, time-dependent complex systems including molecular, neuronal, social, ecological and economic networks. 

The package features an implementation that maps a standard integer-labelled vertex representation to a more user-friendly framework exporting all the objects a practitioner would expect such as nodes, vertices, layers, interlayers, etc. 

MultilayerGraphs.jl has been integrated within the JuliaGraphs [2]
and the JuliaDynamics [3] ecosystems through: 
- the extension of Graphs.jl [4] with several methods and metrics including the multilayer eigenvector centrality, the multilayer modularity and the Von Newman entropy; 
- the compatibility with Agents.jl [5] allowing for agent-based modelling on general multilayer networks.

In our talk we will briefly introduce the theory and applications of multilayer graphs, showcase some of the main features of the current version of the package through a quick tutorial and talk about its planned future developments.

For a more comprehensive exploration of the package functionalities and further details on the future developments the user is invited to consult the package README [6], documentation [7] and issues [8].
