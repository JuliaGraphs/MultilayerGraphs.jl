\begin{abstract}
The abstract should briefly summarize the contents of the paper in
150--250 words.

MultilayerGraphs.jl is a Julia package for the creation, manipulation 
and analysis of the structure, dynamics and functions of multilayer graphs. 
A multilayer graph consists of multiple subgraphs called layers which 
can be interconnected through bipartite graphs called interlayers. 

In order to formally represent multilayer networks, multiple theoretical frameworks have been proposed and adopted to model a wide spectrum of high-dimensional, non-linear, multi-scale, time-dependent complex systems including molecular, neuronal, socio-technical and economic networks. 

The package features an implementation that maps a standard integer-labelled vertex representation to a more user-friendly framework exporting all the objects a practitioner would expect such as nodes, vertices, layers, interlayers, etc.

MultilayerGraphs.jl is integrated within the [**JuliaGraphs**](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs) ecosystem extending [Graphs.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/Graphs.jl) with several multilayer-specific methods and metrics and within the [**JuliaDynamics**](https://github.com/JuliaDynamics) ecosystem allowing for agent-based modelling on general multilayer networks via [Agents.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDynamics/Agents.jl).

For a comprehensive exploration of its features and functionalities we recommend to consult the package [README](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/MultilayerGraphs.jl/blob/main/README.md) and [documentation](https://juliagraphs.org/MultilayerGraphs).

\section{First Section}
\subsection{A Subsection Sample}
Please note that the first paragraph of a section or subsection is
not indented. The first paragraph that follows a table, figure,
equation etc. does not need an indent, either.

Subsequent paragraphs, however, are indented.

\subsubsection{Sample Heading (Third Level)} Only two levels of
headings should be numbered. Lower level headings remain unnumbered;
they are formatted as run-in headings.

\paragraph{Sample Heading (Fourth Level)}
The contribution should contain no more than four levels of
headings. Table~\ref{tab1} gives a summary of all heading levels.

\begin{table}
\caption{Table captions should be placed above the
tables.}\label{tab1}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
Heading level &  Example & Font size and style\\
\hline
Title (centered) &  {\Large\bfseries Lecture Notes} & 14 point, bold\\
1st-level heading &  {\large\bfseries 1 Introduction} & 12 point, bold\\
2nd-level heading & {\bfseries 2.1 Printing Area} & 10 point, bold\\
3rd-level heading & {\bfseries Run-in Heading in Bold.} Text follows & 10 point, bold\\
4th-level heading & {\itshape Lowest Level Heading.} Text follows & 10 point, italic\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


\noindent Displayed equations are centered and set on a separate
line.
\begin{equation}
x + y = z
\end{equation}
Please try to avoid rasterized images for line-art diagrams and
schemas. Whenever possible, use vector graphics instead (see
Fig.~\ref{fig1}).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig1.eps}
\caption{A figure caption is always placed below the illustration.
Please note that short captions are centered, while long ones are
justified by the macro package automatically.} \label{fig1}
\end{figure}

\begin{theorem}
This is a sample theorem. The run-in heading is set in bold, while
the following text appears in italics. Definitions, lemmas,
propositions, and corollaries are styled the same way.
\end{theorem}
%
% the environments 'definition', 'lemma', 'proposition', 'corollary',
% 'remark', and 'example' are defined in the LLNCS documentclass as well.

\begin{proof}
Proofs, examples, and remarks have the initial word in italics,
while the following text appears in normal font.
\end{proof}
For citations of references, we prefer the use of square brackets
and consecutive numbers. Citations using labels or the author/year
convention are also acceptable. The following bibliography provides
a sample reference list with entries for journal
articles~\cite{ref_article1}, an LNCS chapter~\cite{ref_lncs1}, a
book~\cite{ref_book1}, proceedings without editors~\cite{ref_proc1},
and a homepage~\cite{ref_url1}. Multiple citations are grouped
\cite{ref_article1,ref_lncs1,ref_book1},
\cite{ref_article1,ref_book1,ref_proc1,ref_url1}.

\subsubsection{Acknowledgements} Please place your acknowledgments at
the end of the paper, preceded by an unnumbered run-in heading (i.e.
3rd-level heading).
