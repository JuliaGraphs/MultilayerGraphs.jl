**MultilayerGraphs.jl** is a Julia package for the construction, manipulation and analysis of multilayer graphs [extending Graphs.jl](https://juliagraphs.org/Graphs.jl/dev/ecosystem/interface/).

## Overview 

**MultilayerGraphs.jl** implements the mathematical formulation of multilayer graphs proposed by [De Domenico et al. (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevX.3.041022). It mainly revolves around two custom types, [`MultilayerGraph`](@ref) and [`MultilayerDiGraph`](@ref), encoding undirected and directed multilayer graphs respectively. 

Roughly speaking, a multilayer graph is a collection of graphs, called *layers*, whose vertices are representations of the same set of nodes endowed with a relational structure provided by the *interlayer*: the [bipartite graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartite_graph) whose vertices are those of any two consecutive layers and whose edges are those between nodes of the two consecutive layers. See below for the distinction between *node* and *vertex*.

[`MultilayerGraph`](@ref) and [`MultilayerDiGraph`](@ref) are fully-fledged [Graphs.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/Graphs.jl) extensions. Both structs are designed so that their layers and interlayers can be of any type (as long as they are Graphs.jl extensions themselves) and they need not be all of the same type. It is anyway required that all layers and interlayers of [`MultilayerGraph`](@ref) and [`MultilayerDiGraph`](@ref) are respectively undirected and directed. Directedness is checked via the `IsDirected` trait defined in Graphs.jl adopting [SimpleTraits.jl](https://github.com/mauro3/SimpleTraits.jl). Since the layers' and interlayers' graph types don't need to be the same, multilayer graph types are considered weighted graphs by default, and thus are assigned the trait `IsWeighted`.

## Installation

Press `]` in the Julia REPL and then

```julia
pkg> add https://github.com/InPhyT/MultilayerGraphs.jl
```

## Tutorial 

In the package documentation we have written a [tutorial](https://inphyt.github.io/MultilayerGraphs.jl/stable/#Tutorial) to illustrate how to define, handle and analyse a [`MultilayerGraph`](@ref) (the directed version is completely analogous).

## Future Developments
- [ ] Better integration with [Graphs.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/Graphs.jl) (e.g. move the `AbstractVertex` to Graphs.jl, standardize graphs constructors, etc.);
- [ ] Better integration with [MetaGraphs.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/MetaGraphs.jl) and [SimpleValueGraphs.jl](https://github.com/simonschoelly/SimpleValueGraphs.jl). Although it is possible to specify a `MetaGraph` and `SimpleValueGraph` as layer and/or interlayer, they are not yet fully supported (i.e. API may be a little unfit for them). An example using MetaGraphs, SimpleValueGraphs can be found at our announcement post [here]();
- [ ] Optimise the adjacency tensor;
- [ ] More intuitive constructor for `Interlayer`;
- [ ] Implement specialised and simplified API for `MultiplexGraph`;
- [ ] Implement visualisation functionalities;
- [ ] Implement other features and methods for the analysis of multilayer graphs following the scientific literature:
