# DESCRIPTION
# GraphOfGraphs and DiGraphOfGraphs are the representations of undirected or directed graph of graphs

"""
    abstract type AbstractGraphOfGraphs{T <: AbstractGraph} <: AbstractGraph{T} end

An abstract type representing a graph of graphs.
"""
abstract type AbstractGraphOfGraphs{T <: AbstractGraph} <: AbstractGraph{T} end

"""
    mutable struct GraphOfGraphs{T} <: AbstractGraphOfGraphs{T}

Default undirected concrete implementation of `AbstractGraphOfGraphs`.

# FIELDS

- `nodes::OrderedDict{Int64,T}`: An `OrderedDict` that associates graphs (values) to Int64 nodes (keys).
- `graph::SimpleWeightedGraph{Int64,Float64}`: The weighted undirected graph representing the graph of graphs. Its Int64 nodes are associated to graphs via the `nodes` field.

"""
    GraphOfGraphs(graphs::Vector{T}, adjacency_matrix::Matrix{Float64})

Outer constructor for GraphOfGraphs.

# ARGUMENTS

- `graphs::Vector{T}`: The vector of nodes of the graphs of graphs. Each of them will be assigned to an integer, from 1 to length(graphs), and their order is assumed to be the same as the rows and columns of the `adjacency_matrix` argument.
- `adjacency_matrix::Matrix{Float64}`: The adjacency matrix of the graph of graphs. Its (i,j)-element is the weight of the link between `graphs[i]` and `graphs[j]`.
