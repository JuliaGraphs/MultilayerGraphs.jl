    tensorsplit(A, a, b; kwargs...)

Calls tensorsvd with the arguments given to it to decompose the given tensor
A with indices a on one side and indices b on the other.  It then splits
the diagonal matrix of singular values into two with a square root and
multiplies these weights into the isometric tensors.  Thus tensorsplit ends
up splitting A into two parts, which are then returned, possibly together
with auxiliary data such as a truncation error. If the keyword argument
hermitian=true, an eigenvalue decomposition is used in stead of an SVD. All
the keyword arguments are passed to either tensorsvd or tensoreig.

See tensorsvd and tensoreig for further documentation.

Finds the "right" eigenvectors and eigenvalues of A. The indices of A are
permuted so that the indices listed in the Array/Tuple a are on the "left"
side and indices listed in b are on the "right".  The resulting tensor is
then reshaped to a matrix, and eig is called on this matrix to get the vector
of eigenvalues E and matrix of eigenvectors U. Finally, U is reshaped to
a tensor that has as its last index the one that enumerates the eigenvectors
and the indices in a as its first indices.

Truncation and error printing work as with tensorsvd.

Note that no iterative techniques are used, which means that choosing to
truncate provides no performance benefits: All the eigenvalues are computed
in any case.

The keyword argument hermitian (false by default) tells the algorithm
whether the reshaped matrix is Hermitian or not. If hermitian=true, then A =
U*diagm(E)*U' up to the truncation error.

Output is E, U, and possibly error, if return_error=true. Here E is a
vector of eigenvalues values and U[:,...,:,k] is the kth eigenvector.

Singular valued decomposes a tensor A. The indices of A are
permuted so that the indices listed in the Array/Tuple a are on the "left"
side and indices listed in b are on the "right".  The resulting tensor is
then reshaped to a matrix, and this matrix is SVDed into U*diagm(S)*Vt.
Finally, the unitary matrices U and Vt are reshaped to tensors so that
they have a new index coming from the SVD, for U as the last index and for
Vt as the first, and U has indices a as its first indices and V has
indices b as its last indices.

If eps>0 then the SVD may be truncated if the relative error can be kept
below eps. For this purpose different dimensions to truncate to can be tried,
and these dimensions should be listed in chis. If chis is nothing (the
default) then the full range of possible dimensions is tried. If
break_degenerate=false (the default) then the truncation never cuts between
degenerate singular values. degeneracy_eps controls how close the values need
to be to be considered degenerate.

norm_type specifies the norm used to measure the error. This defaults to
:frobenius, which means that the error measured is the Frobenius norm of the
difference between A and the decomposition, divided by the Frobenius norm of
A.  This is the same thing as the 2-norm of the singular values that are
truncated out, divided by the 2-norm of all the singular values. The other
option is :trace, in which case a 1-norm is used instead.

If print_error=true the truncation error is printed. The default is false.

If return_error=true then the truncation error is also returned.
The default is false.

Note that no iterative techniques are used, which means choosing to truncate
provides no performance benefits: The full SVD is computed in any case.

Output is U, S, Vt, and possibly error. Here S is a vector of
singular values and U and Vt are isometric tensors (unitary if the matrix
that is SVDed is square and there is no truncation) such that  U*diag(S)*Vt =
A, up to truncation errors.
